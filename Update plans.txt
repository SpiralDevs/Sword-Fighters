Add GUI (player elims, time (top-centered))

Random Name Generator(right next to nameTF)

Death Animation

Player ID in account menu with copy to clipboard button

Find game button

Either add collision around map or once the player falls off map they die and get the game over screen

player list in game - tab

if the player's current name is < 1 it will automaticlly generate a name for them like "Sword Fighter 273" (the name will always be "Sword Fighter " then a random number from 69-420 hehe lol0)
